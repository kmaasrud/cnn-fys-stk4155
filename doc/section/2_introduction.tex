\section{Introduction}
Spectacular advancements in deep learning has been constructed and perfected with time, primarily over the convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm. The use of CNNs has grown due to its success with a vast array of applications including image classification \cite{He_2016_CVPR}, speech recognition \cite{AbdelHamid2013ExploringCN} and self-driving cars \cite{Wu_2017_CVPR_Workshops}. The aforementioned list of applications is far from complete, but it demonstrates the versatility and the importance of the CNN algorithm. 

The purpose of this work is compare the performance of an ordinary logistic regression with convolutional neural network on the fashion-MNIST and AI face mask detection dataset. The fashion-MNIST is a good benchmark dataset which poses a more challenging classification task than the simple MNIST digits data.
