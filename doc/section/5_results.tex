\section{Results}

\subsection{Fashion-MNIST}
\subsubsection{CNN}
The training session for the CNN on the Fashion-MNIST dataset initially developed promisingly. However, the loss shown in the validation set quickly increased in the last epochs, as shown in figure \ref{fig:fashion_mnist_cnn_history}

\subsubsection{Logistic regression}
The logistic regression model was applied on the mnist fashion dataset. The logistic regression resulted in an accuracy of 84\% when applied to the test set. The accuracy from the train set was 88\%. The confusion matrix which shows the accuracy of each article can be seen in figure \ref{fig:logreg_mnist_cm}.

\subsection{Face mask detection}
\subsubsection{CNN}
After training on the dataset, our model classified a collection of real pictures of people with facemasks. 

In addition to using the supplied testing set, we snapped a couple of pictures of ourselves to test the network on. Here are some examples and the results the network provided.


\subsubsection{Logistic regression}
The logistic regression model was applied on the face mask dataset. The logistic regression resulted with an accuracy score of 48\% when applied to the test set. The confusion matrix which shows the accuracy of the predicted classifications can be seen in figure \ref{fig:logreg_facemask_cm}. Some of the miss classified images can be seen in figure \ref{fig:missclassified_logreg_facemask}

\end{figure}


Since the dataset consisted of images of people with facemasks edited on instead of wearing real physical masks, the model was tested on a few pictures taken by ourself to check how the model performed after training. The results can be seen in figure \ref{fig:logreg_real_pics}
