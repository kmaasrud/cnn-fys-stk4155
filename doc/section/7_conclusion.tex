\section{Conclusion}
After exploring the use of CNN and logistic regression for image classification, it is safe to say that CNN with an outstanding 98\% accuracy on the facemask easily outperforms logistic regression which only managed an accuracy of 48\% on the same facemask dataset.

(Need more conclusion here- Conclusion is a bit short)

Comparing our results with scientific articles like \cite{scientific_article_1} and \cite{scientific_article_2} that also have been studying the use of machine learning for face mask detection, by using CNNs, put our CNN really close to their performance. They managed to achieve accuracy scores of 99.49\% and ~99\% respectively.

\subsection{Prospects for the future}
The main prospect for the future would be to dive into the fine tunings of CNNs and explore further how different parameters affect the accuracy, and search even further for ways to push the accuracy closer towards the 100\%. The logistic regression was implemented by using scikit learn, which gives less elbow room for optimization.

Another interesting prospect for the future would also be to try these methods on more complicated and larger datasets, to see how they fare in other scenarios.
