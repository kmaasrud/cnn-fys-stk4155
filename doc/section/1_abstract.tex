We classify the fashion-MNIST dataset with a logistic regression and a convolutional neural network (CNN); this as a learning exercise before using the same methods to classify the AI face mask detection dataset. Their performance is compared and the accuracy of each is discussed. On the fashion-MNIST dataset, logistic regression was able to achieve an accuracy score of 84\%, while our best CNN model achieved 92\% accuracy. On the AI face mask detection dataset, logistic regression bashed our expectations with an accuracy of 95\%, while our best CNN model achieved an astonishing 98\% accuracy. Our findings shows that CNN outperforms logistic regression in image classification, but logistic regression can still be trusted as long as the images are not too complex.
